## About the Project

This is a CLI app for managers to input employee data, to be rendered into a HTML file that the manager can use to quickly see employee contact information. The constructor functions for the various employee roles have passed a battery of tests to ensure they are functional for building any number of team members reliably. The team.html file will be written to the output directory, which will be created when running the app.

## Usage

Managers can use this CLI app to answer prompts about employee information. This information will then be displayed as a HTML page that they can reference to see team members and their contact info at a glance.
